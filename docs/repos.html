    		 <h3>Simulation of An Altered Segregation Model</h3>
    		 <p>Based on Schelling's segregation model with population composition from Jerusalem's Kiryat HaYovel Neighborhood
		the model depicts three, Jewish, Population Types, each with their own different thresholds for similar neighbors.
		The agents all simulate an attempt to find a community they will feel comfortable in.
		The agents migrate in and out of the neighborhood every 12 ticks, simulating people moving in and out every year.</p>

		<h3>Simulation of An Altered Fire Model</h3>
		<p>A simulation of the classic fire model, with added simulation of forest regeneration.
		Each generation of trees is represented in a different color (expect fire red, earth black, and burned brown).
		The model keeps adding trees and a chance for a forest fire every 50 ticks.
		This is only a short video depicting the process.</p>

		<h3>easycsv</h3>
		<p><u>easycsv</u> is a R library, meant for new and experienced users, who work with many tables at once.
			the library's most useful feature is the fast reading of multiple comma separated tables in .txt or .csv format.
			easycsv is available both on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=easycsv">CRAN</a> and here on <a href="https://github.com/bogind/easycsv">Github</a> (development version). 
		</p>

		<h3>SIRItoGTFS</h3>
		<p>SIRItoGTFS allows you to compare the actual arrival time of
		public transport with the predicted arrival time present in the schedules, represented with the GTFS tables.
		The package was developed as part of my thesis on the subject of "<i>Spatial and Temporal Estimation of the Service Reliability of Public Transportation Using Big Data and Open Source Tools</i>"
		</p>
		<p>The video below shows the results obtained from the analysis, the top half shows the city of Be'er Sheva and the bottom the city of Tel-Aviv, Israel.
		The data for both cities was collected over a week in July 2017.

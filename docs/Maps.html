	   <p style="max-width: 450px;"><font size="4">These maps were first created as part of a JS web mapping course,<br>
     but include a few more details and options than were neccesary because it's fun to play with them</font></p>
     <h3>Map Of Public Transport Average Time Varition From Schedule</h3>
     <p>The map was created based on data collected for my thesis.
     in the city of Be'er Sheva, Israel, for a week in July 2017.
     the data presented respresnts the mean time variation between
     real time bus GPS data collected every 30 seconds and the bus schedule.</p>

	<h3>Map Of Rahat, Israel Lots</h3>
	<p style="max-width: 450px;">Started as a pet project to understand what are the possibilities of web maps,
		i am still exploring and adding more features when i can think of them and implement them.
		the final goal here is to create an open-source map a municipality can use.<br>
		Current Implemented features are:
	<ul>
		<li>Multiple Basemaps Available</li>
		<li>Address Search Using OSM data</li>
		<li>Measurement of Length and Area of user drawn elements</li>
		<li>Cursor Coordinates Location displayed</li>
	</ul>
	Features I still want to implement:
	<ul>
		<li>Selection from data presented, single and multiple objects</li>
		<li>Export of data selected</li>
		<li>Ability to create polygons and<ul>
			<li>Suggest they be inserted to the database</li>
			<li>Export them as a GeoJSON file</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Last clicked location observer<ul>
			<li>Coordinates</li>
			<li>Closest neighborhood and lot</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Creation of Buffer and selection by buffers</li>
	</ul>

	   <p style="max-width: 450px;"><font size="4">These maps were first created as part of a JS web mapping course,<br>
     but include a few more details and options than were neccesary because it's fun to play with them</font></p>
     <h3>Map Of Public Transport Average Time Varition From Schedule</h3>
     <p>The map was created based on data collected for my thesis.
     in the city of Be'er Sheva, Israel, for a week in July 2017.
     the data presented respresnts the mean time variation between
     real time bus GPS data collected every 30 seconds and the bus schedule.</p>

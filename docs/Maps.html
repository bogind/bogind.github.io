     but include a few more details and options than were neccesary because it's fun to play with them</font></p>
     <h3>Map Of Public Transport Average Time Varition From Schedule</h3>
     <p>The map was created based on data collected for my thesis.<br>
     in the city of Be'er Sheva, Israel, for a week in July 2017.
     the data presented respresnts the mean time variation between
     real time bus GPS data collected every 30 seconds and the bus schedule.</p>

     <p>An improvement of the first map,<br>
	with a slicker legend and some a possibility to load parts of the GeoJSON from a remote CARTODB</p>

	<p>A map which allows to check how many cellular antennas are within 500 meters froma clicked location,
	it still loads the time variation layer for Be'er Sheva but by default it's not visible.<br>
	to use the map click the button on the left to calculate the buffers around each antenna
		and then click on the location on the map you want to check.
	the second button on the map will remove the buffers from the map.</p>

	<h3>Map Of Rahat, Israel Lots</h3>
	<p style="max-width: 450px;">Started as a pet project to understand what are the possibilities of web maps,
		i am still exploring and adding more features when i can think of them and implement them.
		the final goal here is to create an open-source map a municipality can use.<br>
		Current Implemented features are:
	<ul>
		<li>&#9745 Multiple Basemaps Available</li>
		<li>&#9745 Address Search Using OSM data</li>
		<li>&#9745 Measurement of Length and Area of user drawn elements</li>
		<li>&#9745 Cursor Coordinates Location displayed</li>
	</ul>
	Features I still want to implement:
	<ul>
		<li>&#9744 Selection from data presented, single and multiple objects</li>
		<li>&#9744 Export of data selected</li>
		<li>&#9744 Ability to create polygons and<ul>
			<li>&#9744 Suggest they be inserted to the database</li>
			<li>&#9744 Export them as a GeoJSON file</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>&#9744 Last clicked location observer<ul>
			<li>&#9745 Coordinates</li>
			<li>&#9744 Closest neighborhood and lot</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>&#9744 Creation of Buffer and selection by buffers</li>
		<li>&#9745 Information dashboard - including live weather update (don't know what else right now)</li>
	</ul>

About 2 weeks ago I saw a tweet by Kate Berg, AKA [Pokato]() about how cool would it be if we could make mods for GIS software, like ones for games.

My initial response was

{% twitter https://twitter.com/bogind2/status/1808713251946971630 %}

Then i got thinking, how hard would it be to add sound effects to QGIS?  
My initial intuition was that it shouldn't be that much of an issue.

{: .box-warning} My initial intuition was wrong.

### Hello!
I'm Dror Bogin, a GIS developer and open source GIS advocate, this is my personal site. 

You can read [about me]({{ '/aboutme' | relative_url }}), check out some of the [projects]({{ '/projects' | relative_url }}) I've worked on, [talks]({{ '/talks' | relative_url }}) I gave, or find my [contact]({{ '/contact' | relative_url }}) information (also at the bottom).

I'm currently working on moving my blog here, and doing so chronologically, so if you're looking for a specific post, it might not be here yet, but you can find a link to the old blog in the [blog]({{ '/aboutme' | relative_url }}) page.
